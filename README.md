correcthorse
============

Password generator based on http://xkcd.com/936/ and http://www.baekdal.com/insights/password-security-usability

This fork of correcthorse, does not run in Windows, it requires the pseudodevice /dev/urandom and a ANSI colour capable terminal (or an uncolour filter).
If you happen to use Windows, the original implementation may work: https://github.com/rmartinjak/correcthorse
